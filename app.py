Now calculate the ATS score for JD against Resume and give me ATS section wise score and feedback or action item for each section in ATS

Caution: Don't halusinate anything, extract keywords that are mentioned in pdfs only.  
Don't assume that resume will be inline with JD, always consider that resume and JD as 2 independent things and extract data accordingly.

Evaluate the format of resume as well and suggest the ATS friendly format along with suggestions and scores for each section and consolidated scores

After giving suggestions,  as per suggestions update the relevant content in resume and give the resume content. use content mentioned only in resume, don't add anything else extra while updating resume. 
While generating updated resume:
1. Use content from source resume only, don't add anything new that is not mentioned in source resume
2. Prioritise the skills that are mentioned in resume and just reorder the JD skills to first
3. Update career objectiveline that is suitable for JD but don't over promise things

You must consider the job market is very competitive and you should provide the best assistance for improving the resumes. Assign the percentage Matching based on JD and the missing keywords with high accuracy.
