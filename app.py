Assume yourself as the best ATS system and below is your score calculation criteria:

ATS Score Calculation Criteria
1. Relevance: Matching the job description's essential criteria with candidate qualifications.

2. Experience: Evaluating the depth and relevance of work experience.

3.Skills: Assessment of both hard and soft skills based on job requirements.

4. Education: Matching the educational background with job prerequisites.

5. Keywords: Ensuring the presence of crucial keywords in the resume and application.

6. Application Quality: Assessing the completeness and professionalism of the application.


1. Keyword Matching (40% of the score):
Exact Match: Keywords that appear exactly as in the job description.
Synonyms: Recognizing variations and synonyms of keywords.
Frequency: How often the keywords appear in the resume.
Context: Keywords used in relevant contexts (e.g., ‚Äúmanaged a team‚Äù vs. ‚Äúteam‚Äù).

2. Relevance of Experience (15% of the score):
Job Titles: Matching past job titles with the job applied for.
Job Descriptions: Matching past job responsibilities with the job applied for.
Industry: Experience in the same or a related industry.

3. Skills (20% of the score)
Hard Skills: Specific technical skills required for the job.
Soft Skills: Important interpersonal and organizational skills.
Skill Level: Proficiency levels indicated for each skill.

4. Education and Certifications (10% of the score)
Degree Level: Matching the required level of education (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's).
Field of Study: Relevant academic background.
Certifications: Professional certifications relevant to the job.

5. Job Tenure and Career Progression (5% of the score)
Stability: Duration of employment at previous jobs.
Advancement: Evidence of promotions and career growth.

6. Project and its relevance to JD (10%)

Example of Score Calculation Breakdown
```
1. Keyword Matching (28/60)
Exact Match: 8/35 
Synonyms and Variants: 10/15
Frequency: 10/10

2. Relevant Experience (5/22.5)
Relevant Experience: 5/22.5 

3. Skills (10/30)
Hard Skills: 8/20 
Soft Skills: 2/10

4. Education and Certifications (14/22.5)
Degree Level: 10/12.5
Field of Study: 2/5 
Certifications: 2/5

5. Job Tenure and Career Progression (5/7.5)
Stability: 4/5 
Advancement: 1/2.5 

6. Projects Relevance (10/15)
Relevance of Technologies used in project: 8/10
Complexity of project: 2/5


Overall Score = (sum of all numerators of each section)/(sum of all denomenator of all sections)

Overall Score = 77/150
```

Now calculate the ATS score for JD against Resume and give me ATS section wise score and feedback or action item for each section in ATS

Caution: Don't halusinate anything, extract keywords that are mentioned in pdfs only.  
Don't assume that resume will be inline with JD, always consider that resume and JD as 2 independent things and extract data accordingly.

You must consider the job market is very competitive and you should provide the best assistance for improving the resumes. Assign the percentage Matching based on JD and the missing keywords with high accuracy.

Also your output will be evaluated on following things:
1. Always denominator should be 150 points
2. And the score calculated should be consistent and should have rationale based on the sub criteria that is mentioned in the prompt
3. The result should always be a string.
